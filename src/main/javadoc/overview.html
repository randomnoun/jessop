<p>The <b>jessop</b> project provides multi-language templates in the style of Java Server Pages.

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The jessop syntax should be familiar to anyone who has written JSPs. A jessop
<b>source script</b> may contain
<!-- 
  the doxia sink API doesn't support 'code' html tags, you can't put attributes on 'tt' tags,
  and it automatically puts 'div's around inline-blocked 'pre' elements. christ. 
  i hereby renew my pledge to find out who designed this, where they live, and then set fire to their loved ones.
  -->
<ul class="bullet">
<li><b>unprocessed text</b>
<li>a <b>declaration</b> in the form <code>&lt;%@ jessop language="javascript" engine="rhino" %&gt;</code>
<li><b>expressions</b> to generate output in the form <code>&lt;%= name %&gt;</code> 
<li><b>scriptlets</b> to execute arbitrary code in the form <code>&lt;% if (name==null) { %&gt;</code><tt> No name </tt><code>&lt;% } %&gt;</code>
</ul> 

<p>Other JSP features such as JSP-EL, beans, tag libraries, and access to HTTP session, request or 
response objects are not implemented by this ScriptEngine (although if you really wanted to, you could 
implement a Servlet to serve up jessop files with request/response variables defined).

<p>Jessop operates by translating the jessop <b>source script</b> into a <b>target language script</b>,
which is composed entirely of statements in the <b>target language</b>.

<p>Care is taken to <b>preserve line numbers</b> between the source script and the target language script
so that runtime errors that occur in the target language script can be easily traced back to the
corresponding line in the source script. Some target languages, such as python, have overly strict
whitespace conventions, and so line numbers may not be preserved in all cases. 

<h3>Declarations</h3>

<p><b>Declarations</b> consist of any text within a <code>&lt;%@ ... @%&gt;</code> block.

<p>Declarations are used to supply information to the jessop engine, such as the target language
being used, the target engine, the filename to use in exception messages and other 
internal configuration options.

<p>A script may have any number of declarations, but since jessop does not currently support
mixing languages within the same source script, you should only have at most one declaration defined at 
the top of the file.

<p>Target languages may also define their own declarations (although this is not the case
for any of the pre-defined languages)

<p>The <b>jessop declaration</b> is in the form 
<code>&lt;%@ jessop name1="value1" name2="value2" ... @%&gt;</code>. 

<p>The developer may supply their own default declaration values to the ScriptEngine using 
ENGINE_SCOPE bindings, otherwise jessop-defined defaults will apply.

<p>Current <b>jessop declaration attributes</b> are:

<table class="padded">
<tr><th>Attribute name <th>JessopScriptEngine constant  <th>jessop-defined default  <th>Description
<tr><td>filename  
    <td>{@link javax.script.ScriptEngine#FILENAME FILENAME}  <td><i>null</i>
    <td>The filename of the jessop source script. This filename will be included in 
        ScriptExceptions that occur when the target language script is evaluated.
<tr><td>language  
    <td>{@link com.randomnoun.common.jessop.JessopScriptEngine#JESSOP_LANGUAGE JESSOP_LANGUAGE}  
    <td><tt>javascript</tt>  
    <td>The target language used within the jessop script for expressions and scriptlets
        <p>This must be the same string returned by the 
        {@link com.randomnoun.common.jessop.JessopScriptBuilder#getLanguage()}} method.
<tr><td>engine  
    <td>{@link com.randomnoun.common.jessop.JessopScriptEngine#JESSOP_ENGINE JESSOP_ENGINE}  
    <td><tt>rhino</tt>  
    <td>The name of the ScriptEngine used to evaluate the target language script.
        <p>This should be the same string that the ScriptEngine uses to identify itself; see
        {@link javax.script.ScriptEngineManager#getEngineByName(String)}.
<tr><td>exceptionConverter  
    <td>{@link com.randomnoun.common.jessop.JessopScriptEngine#JESSOP_EXCEPTION_CONVERTER JESSOP_EXCEPTION_CONVERTER}  <td><i>null</i>  
    <td>The class name of a {@link com.randomnoun.common.jessop.JessopExceptionConverter} that will
        be used to convert exceptions raised by the target language's ScriptEngine to 
        ScriptExceptions. (This should not normally be required, but exists as a workaround for
        the beanshell and luaj engines, which do not do this properly).
<tr><td>compileTarget  
    <td>{@link com.randomnoun.common.jessop.JessopScriptEngine#JESSOP_COMPILE_TARGET JESSOP_COMPILE_TARGET}
    <td><tt>true</tt>
    <td>If true, and if the target language ScriptEngine supports it, will attempt to compile 
        the target script before evaluation. This may result in increased execution speed.
<tr><td>suppressEol  
    <td>{@link com.randomnoun.common.jessop.JessopScriptEngine#JESSOP_SUPPRESS_EOL JESSOP_SUPPRESS_EOL}  
    <td><tt>false</tt>
    <td>This attribute will suppress any trailing whitespace and the newline character that
        appears after a <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> scriptlet from appearing in the 
        evaluated target language script output. Whitespace/newline suppression will
        only occur if the scriptlet appears at the end of a line in the jessop source. 
        <p>The suppressEol attribute is used for jessop scripts used for code generation.

<h3>Unprocessed text</h3>

<p><b>Unprocessed text</b> consists of any text that appears in the jessop source that is not
contained in a declaration, expression, or scriptlet.

<p>When unprocessed text is encountered in the jessop source script, the text is converted into code
that prints that text to the output PrintWriter. The text is escaped if necessary in order to 
represent it in the target language's native string type.

<p>e.g. if the jessop target language is 'javascript', then the unprocessed text

<pre>Lovely day isn't it</pre>

will be converted into

<pre>out.print('Lovely day isn\'t it\n');</pre>


<h3>Expressions</h3>

<p><b>Expressions</b> consist of any text within a <code>&lt;%= ... @%&gt;</code> block.

<p>When expressions are encountered in the jessop source script, they are converted into code in the
target language script that will evaluate the block output, and the print that value to the output PrintWriter.

<p>e.g. if the jessop target language is 'javascript', then the expression block

<pre>&lt;%= name @%&gt;</pre>

will be converted into

<pre>out.print(name);</pre>



<h3>Scriptlets</h3>

<p><b>Scriptlets</b> consist of any text within a <code>&lt;% ... @%&gt;</code> block.

<p>The term 'scriptlets' is the same term used in the Java Server Pages (JSP) specification.

<p>Scriptlet blocks should contain code written in the target language. When scriptlets are encountered 
in the jessop source script, this code is copied into the target language script verbatim.

<p>e.g. if the jessop target language is 'javascript', then the expression block

<pre>&lt;% if (name==null) { %&gt; No name &lt;% } %&gt;</pre>

will be converted into

<pre>if (name==null) { out.print(name); }</pre>

<p>There are no constraints placed on what actions a scriptlet may perform;
a scriptlet may define new variables or functions, call functions, or even call Java code if
the target scripting language supports it, including undesired actions such as terminated 
the JVM via a System.exit() call.  

If you are running scripts defined by other users and do wish to restrict what 
actions a scriptlet may perform, run the ScriptEngine within a SecurityManager.
