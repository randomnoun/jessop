 * 
things for jessop, if I get around to doing that:

- register the project name on github or sf
  it's namespaced anyway to my user/org anyway. OR IS IT.
- decide on a scriptx registration; 
  thinking 'jessop-jste'/'jessop-jssp'/'jessop-jasper' for those, otherwise
  'jessop-javascript' for <%@ language="javascript" %>
  'jessop-jython' for <%@ language="jython" %>
  and whatever other scriptx languages are out there  
  etc
  
anyhoo.
