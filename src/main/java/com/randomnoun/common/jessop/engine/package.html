Engine-specific classes (exception converters and bindings converters).

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>This package contains implementations of the 
{@link com.randomnoun.common.jessop.JessopExceptionConverter} interface.

<p>The only reason these things exist is because the most script engines 
don't include file names or numbers in their ScriptExceptions correctly.

<p>We now also have BindingsConverters, which make any java.util.Map and 
java.util.List objects in the context bindings look more like whatever the
their native scripting engine equivalents are. e.g. @{link java.util.List}s become 
javascript arrays in the rhino engine.
