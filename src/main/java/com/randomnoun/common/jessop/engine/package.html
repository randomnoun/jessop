Engine-specific classes (exception converters).

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>This package contains implementations of the 
{@link com.randomnoun.common.jessop.JessopExceptionConverter} interface.

<p>The only reason these things exist is because the 'bsh' and 'luaj' script engines 
don't throw ScriptExceptions properly.

<p>If we need some other kinds of per-engine processing, it'll probably go into this package somewhere.
